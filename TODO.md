We need to firstly check that our model replicates that of Riccetti et al 2013.
Then we can move on and validate the output of the model.

* DONE Check firm-bank adjacency matrix
-- Firms use 1 bank but banks have many clients

* Check negative prices

* Research financial accelerator literature

* Check correlation with Riccetti et al 2013
